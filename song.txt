I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time
And every creature lens themselves to change your state of mind
And the girl that chase the rabbit drank the wine and took the pill
Has locked herself in limbo to see how it truly feels
To stand outside your virtue
No one can ever hurt you
Or so they say
Her name is Alice (Alice)
She crawls into the window
Shaped in shadows
Alice (Alice)
And even though she is dreaming, she knows
